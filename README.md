# Raft Consensus Implementation

This project contains a Raft-based consensus as well as BFT-based implementation written in Go.

To access the implementation, navigate to the `raftconsensus` directory:

```bash
cd raftconsensus
```
To access the implementation, navigate to the `BFTCONSENSUS` directory:
```bash
cd bftconsensus
```
The BFT based consensus isn't working to the full extent (still working on it)
