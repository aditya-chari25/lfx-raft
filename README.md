## Raft Consensus Implementation

This project contains a **Raft-based consensus** as well as a **BFT-based implementation** written in Go.

I used **go-blueprint** to initially generate the files for this project, which provides a solid structure for a Go project, anticipating future large-scale development. I've also developed **routes for communication**, which you can find within the inner folders, along with detailed explanations and justifications for their implementation.

---

## Accessing the Implementations

To access the Raft consensus implementation, navigate to the `raftconsensus` directory:

```bash
cd raftconsensus
```
The BFT based consensus isn't working to the full extent (still working on it)
## BFT Consensus Implementation
Similarly to the above project, this project is also implemented using Go

## Accessing the Implementation

To access the BFT-based implementation, navigate to the bftconsensus directory:

```bash
cd bftconsensus
```
